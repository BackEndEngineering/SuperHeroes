Write down your thoughts and questions: What did you learn? What questions do you still have?

Many concepts I learned after watching the video about REST.
REST stands for representational state transfer is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of components, connectors, and data elements within a distributed hypermedia system, where the focus is on component roles and a specific set of interactions between data elements rather than implementation details. Its purpose is to induce performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.
REST is on standby waiting for  HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
